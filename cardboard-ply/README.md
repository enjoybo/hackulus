Hackulus Thriftus Google Cardboard Display
==========================================

Google Cardboard example taken from [Google Chrome Experiments page](http://vr.chromeexperiments.com/example.html).

This can be run on a mobile device in order to be used with Google Cardboard.

Note: .ply files handled by this program do not use the header. Files include only points and colors.

Further improvements: 
- Allow user to change which ply file to view via web interface
- Allow user to move the figure around (currently this is an issue because of limited inputs available to cardboard).
- Calculate the center and size of the point cloud and adjust its placement in relation to the camera dynamically.
